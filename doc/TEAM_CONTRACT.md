Strategy games.
We are interested in strategy games because they provide us the chance to implement a wide variety of techniques (including but not limited to techniques we have learned in this class). Even better, strategy games are simple and versatile enough for us to implement various techniques on an ad-hoc basis (to demonstrate what we have learned).

checkers, chess, connect4, etc.

save/load games
